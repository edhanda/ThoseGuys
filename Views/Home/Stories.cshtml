            <h5 class="card-title">The Increasing Threat of Forest Fires</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Forest fires are becoming more frequent and more intense, fueled by climate change. As dry seasons lengthen and temperatures soar, entire ecosystems are being destroyed, releasing massive amounts of CO2 back into the atmosphere. This feedback loop is accelerating global warming and pushing wildlife out of their homes. </p>
