                <h5 class="card-title">The Devastating Effects of Climate Change on Wildlife</h5>
                <p class="card-text">As global temperatures continue to rise, wildlife is facing unprecedented challenges. Habitats are shrinking, food sources are becoming scarce, and migration patterns are disrupted. For many species, this means a struggle to survive, with some even facing extinction. <a href="https://www.ifaw.org/ca-en/journal/impact-climate-change-animals#:~:text=Habitat%20loss%3A%20Rising%20temperatures%20affect,other%20animals%20to%20die%20off." class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

                <h5 class="card-title">The Increasing Threat of Forest Fires</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Forest fires are becoming more frequent and more intense, fueled by climate change. As dry seasons lengthen and temperatures soar, entire ecosystems are being destroyed, releasing massive amounts of CO2 back into the atmosphere. This feedback loop is accelerating global warming and pushing wildlife out of their homes. <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>
